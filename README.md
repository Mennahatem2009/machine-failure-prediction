# Machine Failure Prediction (NASA C-MAPSS Dataset)

## Project Description
This project predicts machine failures using NASA's C-MAPSS dataset. The dataset contains sensor readings from industrial engines over time. The goal is to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of engines, helping prevent unexpected failures, reduce maintenance costs, and improve operational efficiency.

## Environment Setup
To set up the environment for this project:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone <your_repo_link_here>
cd <your_repo_name>

3. Install required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## How to Run
1. Run the preprocessing notebook to prepare the data:
jupyter notebook D:\machine failure predection\Jupyter Notebook.ipynb

2. Train the machine learning model

3. Use the prediction script to estimate Remaining Useful Life (RUL)

## Future Actions and Improvements
- Implement more advanced models (e.g., stacked LSTM, GRU) for better accuracy
- Enhance feature engineering and preprocessing
- Perform hyperparameter tuning for optimal model performance
- Add visualizations for feature importance and model predictions
- Build a dashboard for real-time failure monitoring
- Add model monitoring to detect drift and maintain performance over time
